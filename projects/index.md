Decisions about public health response to an outbreak need to be made even when there is substantial uncertainty and unpredictability. Our group develops and applies mathematical and statistical methods to quantify infectious disease dynamics to inform decision support for public health and healthcare response to outbreak. 

Work from our group has been used to guide the public health response to multiple pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 and Diphtheria. We are currently working to better understand how to reconstruct transmission and determine who-infected-whom healthcare associated pathogens, to improve the modeling toolkit for state and local public health agencies across the intermountain west to respond respiratory viruses, and to reduce transmission of epidemic Cholera through expanded treatment.

Healthcare associated infections pose a significant threat to patient safety, however, controlling them remains a challenge.  until we a better understand of how pathogens are spreading. Identifying and controlling routes of transmission within healthcare facilities remains a critical challenge to controlling healthcare associated infections. Because patients generally do not directly contact each other, the majority of transmission must occur through an intermediary vector. However, there are an overwhelming number of potential routes of transmission within a healthcare facility. Determining routes of transmission and identifying the role of environmental surfaces in transmission are essential to controlling healthcare associated infections. Using data from a longitudinal surveillance study in two ICUs, we aim to develop a method that integrates genomic and epidemiologic movement data to identify the role of other patients, environmental surfaces, and HCW hands in the routes of transmission between patients and their environment and thereby facilitate the tailoring of interventions to key steps along the transmission pathway.
