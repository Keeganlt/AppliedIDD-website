Decisions about public health response to an outbreak need to be made even when there is substantial uncertainty and unpredictability. Our group develops and applies mathematical and statistical methods to quantify infectious disease dynamics to inform decision suport for public health and healthcare response to outbreak. 

Work from our group has been used to guide the public health response to multiple pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 and Diphtheria. We are currently working to better understand how to reconstruct transmission and determine who-infected-whom healthcare associated pathogens, to improve the modeling toolkit for state and local public health agencies across the intermountain west to respond respiratory viruses, and to reduce transmission of epidemic Cholera through expanded treatment.
