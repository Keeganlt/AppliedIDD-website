Our lab sits within the [Infectious Disease Dyanmics](https://www.utahinfectiousdiseasedynamics.org/) group at the University of Utah in the [Division of Epidemiology](https://medicine.utah.edu/internal-medicine/epidemiology), within Department of Internal Medicine at the Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine. We are located at the base of the foothills of the beautiful Wasatch Mountains.

Our lab sits on unceded Ute, Goshute, Shoshone, and Paiute land. We honor the relationships these tribes have with this land we occupy; we seek to minimize the harm done to this land, its people, and its ecology.
