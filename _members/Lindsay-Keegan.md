Lindsay is interested in developing and applying mathematical and statistical methods to understand how infectious disease dynamics impact control and elimiation efforts. A major focus of her research centers around partnering with public health and healthcare officials to develop and deploy novel methods for decision support tools in response to disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. She is interested in all manner of statistical and dynamical methods that address questions on the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. Currently she is primarily working on using statistical and mathematical techniques to understand the how pathogens spread in healthcare facilities; on developing a modeling toolkit for state and local public health and healthcare organizations across the intermountain west to respond to respiratory viral outbreaks.  

When sheâ€™s not doing research, you can find Lindsay in the mountains doing all manner of human-powered sports.
